# Structure

IMPORTANT: store files related to understanding existing code (e.g. annotated R files) in the
directory titled `existing` and files containing code written to analyze the new data in the
directory titled `analysis`. Currently, there is only 1 annoted R file in the `existing` directory,
but as can be inferred from above, `analysis` will be useful in the future.
